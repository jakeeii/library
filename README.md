# library

Library project for advanced Javascript course. This project focused around
working with objects, constructors, and, to a lesser degree, prototypes. The
project also tested my layout skills and form styling with CSS, as well as form
validation between HTML and JS. The trickiest part was associating the 'Remove'
button under each book with the correct book object, which I eventually solved
by adding a unique button ID for each button as well as a value attribute which
was associated with the index of each book in the library. 

This library app allows users to create a book list of books they've either
read or want to read. Users can input the title of the book, author, number of
pages, and if they've already read the book when adding a new book to the
library. Books can also be removed once added and the user can also toggle the
'read' status of the book.
